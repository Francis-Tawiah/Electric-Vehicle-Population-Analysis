# Electric Vehicle Population Analysis

![](Intro-image.png)

## Introduction

This is a Power Bi project on electric vehicle population. The project is to analyze and derive insights into the current state of the EV market. The project carefully examines a diverse population of electric vehicles, identifying key trends and preferences among consumers.

## Problem Statement

1. What is the total number of registered electric vehicles?
2. Which County and City has the highest number of registered electric vehicles?
3. What is the average electric range of the registered electric vehicles?
4. What is the average electric range of BEVs and PHEVs?
5. What is the percentage of Battery Electric Vehicles and Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles?
6. Which model has the maximum electric range?
7. What is the most populated model?
8. Who is the leading electric vehicle maker?
9. Which year is the most prevalent electric vehicle model year?

## Skills/Concepts Demonstrated 

The following Power Bi features were incorporated:
- DAX
- Measures
- Tooltips
- Filters

## Modelling

No data was modelled since only the table was needed for the analysis.

## Visualization

The report comprises of 2 pages:
1. Main Page with the KPIs
2. A continuation page.
